## Generated options

### Plugin

> Here is a list of the options you picked when creating the plugin with the cookiecutter template.

| Cookiecutter option | Picked value |
| :------------------ | :----------: |
| Plugin name | EigenBand |
| Plugin name slugified | eigenband |
| Plugin name class (used in code) | Eigenband |
| Plugin category | Raster |
| Plugin description short | Multi-Band Dimensionality Reduction Tool! |
| Plugin description long | EigenBand brings classical machine learning dimensionality reduction directly into the QGIS canvas. It flattens multi-spectral rasters (like Sentinel-2 or Landsat), applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) via scikit-learn, and automatically generates and styles a new 3-band RGB raster based on the top principal components. Perfect for geological mapping, vegetation analysis, and feature extraction. |

### Tooling

This project is configured with the following tools:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format the code without any existential question
- [iSort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to sort the Python imports

Code rules are enforced with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.  
Static code analysis is based on: Flake8

See also: [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## CI/CD

Plugin is linted, tested, packaged and published with GitHub.

If you mean to deploy it to the [official QGIS plugins repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/), remember to set your OSGeo credentials (`OSGEO_USER_NAME` and `OSGEO_USER_PASSWORD`) as environment variables in your CI/CD tool.


### Documentation

The documentation is located in `docs` subfolder, written in Markdown using [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/), structured in two main parts, Usage and Contribution, generated using Sphinx (have a look to [the configuration file](./docs/conf.py)) and is automatically generated through the CI and published on Pages: <https://github.com/osundwajeff/eigenband/pages> (see [post generation steps](#2-build-the-documentation-locally) below).

## Next steps post generation

### 1. Set up development environment

> Typical commands on Linux (Ubuntu).

1. If you didn't pick the `git init` option, initialize your local repository:

    ```sh
    git init
    ```

1. Follow the [embedded documentation to set up your development environment](./docs/development/environment.md) to create  virtual environment and install development dependencies.
1. Add all files to git index to prepare initial commit:

    ```sh
    git add -A
    ```

1. Run the git hooks to ensure that everything runs OK and to start developing on quality standards:

    ```sh
    # run all pre-commit hooks on all files
    pre-commit run -a
    # don't be shy, run it again until it's all green
    ```

### 2. Adjust URL and build the documentation locally

> [!NOTE]
> Since it's very hard to determine which the final documentation URL will be, the templater does not set it up. You have to do it manually.
> The final URL should be something like this: <https://{user_org}.github.io/{project_slug}>. You can find it in Pages settings of your repository: <https://github.com/osundwajeff/eigenband/pages>.

1. Have a look to the [plugin's metadata.txt file](eigenband/metadata.txt): review it, complete it or fix it if needed (URLs, etc.)., especially the `homepage` URL which should be to your GitLab or GitHub Pages.
1. Update the base URL of custom repository in [installation doc page](./docs/usage/installation.md).
1. Change the plugin's icon stored in `eigenband/resources/images`
1. Follow the [embedded documentation to build plugin documentation locally](./docs/development/documentation.md)

### 3. Prepare your remote repository

1. If you did not yet, create a remote repository on your Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
1. Create labels listed in [labeler.yml file](.github/labeler.yml) to make PR auto-labelling work.
1. Switch the source of GitHub Pages to `GitHub Actions` in your repository settings <https://github.com/osundwajeff/eigenband/pages>
1. Add the remote repository to your local repository:

    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/osundwajeff/eigenband
    ```

1. Commit changes:

    ```sh
    git commit -m "init(plugin): adding first files of EigenBand" -m "generated with QGIS Plugin Templater (https://oslandia.gitlab.io/qgis/template-qgis-plugin)"
    ```

1. Push the initial commit to the remote repository:

    ```sh
    git push -u origin main
    ```

1. Create a new release following the [packaging/release guide](./docs//development/packaging.md) with the tag `0.1.0-beta1` to trigger the CI/CD pipeline and publish the plugin on the [official QGIS plugins repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/) (if you picked up the option).


1. After publishing the plugin for the first time on the official QGIS repository, remember to indicate the plugin ID in the [documentation configuration](./docs/conf.py).
